                        Dublin Airport offers both direct and non-direct flights, making it a convenient hub for
                        travelers. Alternatively, you can fly directly to a nearby country in Europe or the UK and take
                        a short connecting flight to Dublin — this is often an economical option.
                        From Dublin, there are several ways to reach the venue. Please take a look at our <a
                            href="travel.html">Travel</a> page for more information.</td>

                        cocktail or formal attire — whatever suits your taste. To honor the bridal colors, we kindly ask
                        you to <b>avoid wearing white or red</b>. Most importantly, pick something comfortable to dance
                        and celebrate in — we know you’ll look fantastic!</td>

                        between spaces, you won’t need to drive, travel, or walk far. Everything is conveniently close

                        18–20°C and cooler evenings. However, Irish weather can be unpredictable, so we recommend
                        bringing layers and a light jacket for the evening!</td>

                        and has arrived in Slane — this is completely optional. We understand the effort it takes to
                        travel for us therefore there are no planned events after the wedding either, so you can enjoy
                        your time in Ireland (or elsewhere) however you like. That said, we’ll be around and would love
                        to have informal meetups with anyone interested.</td>
