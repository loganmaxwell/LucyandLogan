                    <td>There are many ways to reach our wedding venue, but Dublin is the closest airport to fly into. Dublin Airport offers both direct and non-direct flights, making it a convenient hub for travelers. Alternatively, you can fly directly to a nearby country in Europe or the UK and take a short connecting flight to Dublin—this is often an economical option.
                        From Dublin, there are several ways to reach the venue. Please take a look at our<a href="travel.html"> Travel</a>  page for more information.</td>

To honor the bridal colors, we kindly ask you to avoid wearing white or red. Most importantly, pick something comfortable to dance and celebrate in—we know you’ll look fantastic!</td>

We understand the effort it takes to travel for us therefore there are no planned events after the wedding either, so you can enjoy your time in Ireland (or elsewhere) however you like. That said, we’ll be around and would love to plan informal meetups if others are interested.</td>
