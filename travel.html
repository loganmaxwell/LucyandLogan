                        For most of our guests, flying into Dublin Airport (DUB) is the easiest and most convenient option. <b>Dublin</b> is Ireland’s largest international airport, located about 45 minutes from Slane and The Millhouse.
                        <p><b>Flights from Canada</b></p>
                        <ul><li>Guests traveling from Calgary, Victoria, or Toronto can look for direct or one-stop flights to Dublin. Airlines like Air Canada, WestJet, and Aer Lingus often offer competitive rates. </li>
                            <li>Alternatively, an <b>economical option</b> is to fly to a nearby European or UK city (e.g., London or Paris), which often has better flight deals from Canada with the same and other carriers as well. Once there, you can book a short connecting flight to Dublin with a lower-cost carrier.</li></p>
                        <li>Some of our favourite resources to search for flight options are <a href="https://www.google.com/travel/flights/">Google Flights</a> and <a href="https://www.skyscanner.ca/">Skyscanner</a>. We'll also be keeping an eye out for flight deals and if we come across any we'll share it with you all. If you come across any good deals, please share it with us too!

                        <b>Flights from Europe or the UK</b>
                        <ul><li>
                            For those traveling from London or Edinburgh, we're sure you are seasoned travellers already so no need to give you extra tips. Just know you have it good and will make those traveling from Canada very jealous.
                        </li></ul>
                        <b>Cost-Saving Tips</b>
                        <ul><li>
                            Low-Cost Carriers: Airlines like Ryanair and EasyJet offer budget-friendly fares, but be mindful of their baggage policies. Basic fares often don’t include checked luggage, and fees for additional bags can add up quickly.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Full-Service Airlines: If you’re traveling light, British Airways offers reasonably priced flights between the UK and Ireland, with carry-on baggage included. This can be a better option to avoid surprise fees.
                        </li></ul>

                        Once you’ve landed at Dublin Airport, there are several ways to reach Slane and The Millhouse:
                        <p><b>Driving or Car Rental</b></p>
                        <ul><li>Renting a car is a convenient way to travel and explore the Irish countryside. Car rental services are available at Dublin Airport, including Hertz, Enterprise, and Avis.</li>
                            <li>Driving time from Dublin Airport to Slane is about 45 minutes to an hour.</li>
                            <li>Remember: For those traveling from Canada, in Ireland, driving is on the left-hand side and driver & passenger side is also reversed (bigger difference for stick shift). Other things to mind are toll and traffic rules. For more information checkout <a href="https://www.ireland.com/en-ca/plan-your-trip/travel/driving-in-ireland/">Driving in Ireland</a></li>
                        </ul>
                        <b>Private Hire or Taxi</b>
                        <ul><li>
                            For a direct option, consider booking a taxi or private car hire.
                        </li><li>Popular ride-hailing apps like Uber and Lyft are not widely available in Ireland; however, Dublin Airport does support Uber Black, which operates more like a private hire service.
                        </li><li>
                            Local apps like <a href="https://www.lynk.ie/">Lynk</a> or <a href="https://www.free-now.com/">Free Now</a> are reliable and easy to use for booking a ride from Dublin Airport to Slane.
                        </li><li>
                            Expect to pay approximately €80–€100 for the journey.
                        </li><li>
                            If you’re traveling with a group or coordinating with others, private car services or pre-booked shuttles may be a more cost-effective option.
                        </li>

                        <p>After RSVP close, and travel plans from attendees become more firm, we may look into organizing group transportation. Details will be shared closer to the day of the event.

                            <li><b>Cash:</b> While cards are widely accepted, it’s a good idea to have a small amount of cash for rural areas, local markets, or small establishments. ATMs are readily available in Dublin and Slane.</li>
                            <li><b>Tipping:</b> Tipping in Ireland is optional but appreciated. In restaurants, leaving 10-15% of the bill is standard if service isn’t included. For taxis, rounding up to the nearest euro is common.</li>
                            <li><b>Currency Exchange:</b> Currency Exchange: You can exchange money at banks, Dublin Airport, or currency exchange kiosks, but ATMs often provide the best exchange rates. There are other services such as Wise that can add convenience while travelling.</li>
