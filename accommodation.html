                        We are thrilled to offer limited onsite accommodations at The Millhouse for our guests. Staying here means you’ll be right at the heart of the celebration, with no need to worry about transportation to and from the venue.
                        <ul><li><b>Cost: </b> On average rooms at The Millhouse range from approximately €95 to €135 (about $140 - $200 CAD) per night per person for adults. There are exceptions and lower cost options on site as well.</li></ul>
                        <b>Booking Process:</b>
                        <ul><li>When you RSVP, you’ll have the option to indicate if you’re interested in staying onsite.</li>
                        <li>Once RSVPs close, we’ll confirm availability and let you know whether we can accommodate your request. <b>We are hoping to be able to accomodate majority of those interested.</b></li>
                        </ul>
                        <b>What if we're full?</b>
                        <ul><li>If we’re unable to offer you a room onsite, don’t worry! There are many wonderful alternate accommodations options for you to stay near and we will work with you to make sure you are setup with options.</li>
                        </ul>
                      <b>Travel Tip:</b>  If you’re travelling with a large party (such as a family) and/or want peace of mind about having a backup, we recommend booking an alternative option with free cancellation.
